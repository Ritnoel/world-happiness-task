 in conclusion, the correlation analysis shows that the main variables associated with the Happiness Score are Economy, Social Support & Life Expectancy in that order. We can say that the higher he Economy, Social Support, and Life Expectancy, the happier the countries are (or it can also be the other way around). Therefore, money does play a crucial role in terms of happiness. Rich countries will generally be happier, live longer, and have more family support. Surprisingly, the correlation analysis also shows generosity is not related to happiness level.
